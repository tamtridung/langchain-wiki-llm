Permissions
===========

Copy page

Control filesystem access with declarative permission rules for Deep Agents

Copy page

Control which files and directories an agent can read or write to using declarative permission rules. Pass a list of rules to `permissions=` and the agent’s built-in filesystem tools respect them.

Permissions require `deepagents>=0.5.2`.

Permissions only apply to the built-in filesystem tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `write_file`, `edit_file`). Custom tools and MCP tools that access the filesystem are not covered. Permissions also do not apply to [sandbox backends](/oss/python/deepagents/sandboxes), which support arbitrary command execution via the `execute` tool.

Use `permissions` when you need **path-based allow/deny rules** on the built-in filesystem tools. Use [backend policy hooks](/oss/python/deepagents/backends#add-policy-hooks) when you need custom validation logic (rate limiting, audit logging, content inspection) or need to control custom tools.

[​](#basic-usage) Basic usage
-----------------------------

Pass a list of [`FilesystemPermission`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/deepagents/middleware/permissions/FilesystemPermission) rules to [`create_deep_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/deepagents/graph/create_deep_agent). Rules are evaluated in declaration order. The first matching rule wins. If no rule matches, the operation is allowed.

```
from deepagents import FilesystemPermission, create_deep_agent


# Read-only agent: deny all writes
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    permissions=[
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["write"],
            paths=["/**"],
            mode="deny",
        ),
    ],
)
```

[​](#rule-structure) Rule structure
-----------------------------------

Each `FilesystemPermission` has three fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operations` | `list["read" | "write"]` | Operations this rule applies to. `"read"` covers `ls`, `read_file`, `glob`, `grep`. `"write"` covers `write_file`, `edit_file`. |
| `paths` | `list[str]` | Glob patterns for matching file paths (e.g., `["/workspace/**"]`). Supports `**` for recursive matching and `{a,b}` for alternation. |
| `mode` | `"allow" | "deny" | "interrupt"` | Whether to allow, deny, or pause for human approval on matching operations. Defaults to `"allow"`. See [Pause for human approval](#pause-for-human-approval). |

Rules use first-match-wins evaluation: the first rule whose `operations` and `paths` match the current call determines the outcome. If no rule matches, the call is **allowed** (permissive default).

[​](#pause-for-human-approval) Pause for human approval
-------------------------------------------------------

The `"interrupt"` mode requires `deepagents>=0.6.8`.

Set `mode="interrupt"` to pause for human approval instead of allowing or denying a matching operation outright. When the agent calls a built-in write tool (`write_file`, `edit_file`) on a path that matches an interrupt-mode rule, `create_deep_agent` raises a human-in-the-loop interrupt rather than running the tool, and a reviewer can approve, edit, or reject the call.

```
from deepagents import FilesystemPermission, create_deep_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver


agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    permissions=[
        # Pause for approval before writing anything under /secrets.
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["write"],
            paths=["/secrets/**"],
            mode="interrupt",
        ),
    ],
    # Interrupt mode requires a checkpointer to pause and resume.
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
)
```

Interrupt-mode rules are wired into the agent’s human-in-the-loop middleware automatically and merge with any `interrupt_on` you pass, so you handle and resume them the same way as tool-call interrupts. See [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/deepagents/human-in-the-loop) for the resume flow.

Anchor interrupt patterns with a literal leading segment (for example, `/secrets/**` or `/projects/*/secrets/**`). Bulk tools (`ls`, `glob`, `grep`) fire the interrupt when their search subtree could overlap the rule’s anchored prefix, so a fully unanchored pattern like `/**/secrets` conservatively over-fires.

[​](#examples) Examples
-----------------------

### [​](#isolate-to-a-workspace-directory) Isolate to a workspace directory

Allow reads and writes only under `/workspace/` and deny everything else:

```
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    permissions=[
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["read", "write"],
            paths=["/workspace/**"],
            mode="allow",
        ),
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["read", "write"],
            paths=["/**"],
            mode="deny",
        ),
    ],
)
```

### [​](#protect-specific-files) Protect specific files

```
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    permissions=[
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["read", "write"],
            paths=["/workspace/.env", "/workspace/examples/**"],
            mode="deny",
        ),
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["read", "write"],
            paths=["/workspace/**"],
            mode="allow",
        ),
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["read", "write"],
            paths=["/**"],
            mode="deny",
        ),
    ],
)
```

### [​](#read-only-memory) Read-only memory

Allow the agent to read memory files but prevent it from modifying them. This is useful for organization-wide policies or shared knowledge bases that should only be updated by application code. See [read-only vs writable memory](/oss/python/deepagents/memory#read-only-vs-writable-memory) for more context.

```
from deepagents.backends import CompositeBackend, StateBackend, StoreBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    backend=CompositeBackend(
        default=StateBackend(),
        routes={
            "/memories/": StoreBackend(
                namespace=lambda rt: (rt.server_info.user.identity,),
            ),
            "/policies/": StoreBackend(
                namespace=lambda rt: (rt.context.org_id,),
            ),
        },
    ),
    permissions=[
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["write"],
            paths=["/memories/**", "/policies/**"],
            mode="deny",
        ),
    ],
)
```

### [​](#deny-all-access) Deny all access

Block all reads and writes. This is a restrictive baseline you can layer more specific allow rules on top of:

```
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    permissions=[
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["read", "write"],
            paths=["/**"],
            mode="deny",
        ),
    ],
)
```

### [​](#rule-ordering) Rule ordering

Because of first-match-wins, rule order matters. Place more specific rules before broader ones:

```
# Correct: deny .env, allow workspace, deny everything else
correct_permissions = [
    FilesystemPermission(
        operations=["read", "write"],
        paths=["/workspace/.env"],
        mode="deny",
    ),
    FilesystemPermission(
        operations=["read", "write"],
        paths=["/workspace/**"],
        mode="allow",
    ),
    FilesystemPermission(
        operations=["read", "write"],
        paths=["/**"],
        mode="deny",
    ),
]

# Bug: /workspace/** matches .env first, so the deny never triggers
incorrect_permissions = [
    FilesystemPermission(
        operations=["read", "write"],
        paths=["/workspace/**"],
        mode="allow",
    ),
    FilesystemPermission(
        operations=["read", "write"],
        paths=["/workspace/.env"],
        mode="deny",  # never reached
    ),
    FilesystemPermission(
        operations=["read", "write"],
        paths=["/**"],
        mode="deny",
    ),
]
```

[​](#subagent-permissions) Subagent permissions
-----------------------------------------------

[Subagents](/oss/python/deepagents/subagents) inherit the parent agent’s permissions by default. To give a subagent different permissions, set the `permissions` field in its spec. This **replaces** the parent’s rules entirely.

```
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    permissions=[
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["read", "write"],
            paths=["/workspace/**"],
            mode="allow",
        ),
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["read", "write"],
            paths=["/**"],
            mode="deny",
        ),
    ],
    subagents=[
        {
            "name": "auditor",
            "description": "Read-only code reviewer",
            "system_prompt": "Review the code for issues.",
            "permissions": [
                FilesystemPermission(
                    operations=["write"],
                    paths=["/**"],
                    mode="deny",
                ),
                FilesystemPermission(
                    operations=["read"],
                    paths=["/workspace/**"],
                    mode="allow",
                ),
                FilesystemPermission(
                    operations=["read"],
                    paths=["/**"],
                    mode="deny",
                ),
            ],
        }
    ],
)
```

[​](#composite-backends) Composite backends
-------------------------------------------

When using a [`CompositeBackend`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/deepagents/backends/composite/CompositeBackend) with a sandbox default, every permission path must be scoped under a known route prefix. Sandboxes support arbitrary command execution, so path-based restrictions alone cannot prevent filesystem access through shell commands. Scoping permissions to route-specific [backends](/oss/python/deepagents/backends) avoids this conflict.

```
from deepagents.backends import CompositeBackend


composite = CompositeBackend(
    default=sandbox,
    routes={"/memories/": memories_backend},
)

# Works: permissions are scoped to the /memories/ route
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    backend=composite,
    permissions=[
        FilesystemPermission(
            operations=["write"],
            paths=["/memories/**"],
            mode="deny",
        ),
    ],
)
```

Permissions that include paths outside any route raise `NotImplementedError`:

```
# Raises NotImplementedError: /workspace/** hits the sandbox default
try:
    create_deep_agent(
        model=model,
        backend=composite,
        permissions=[
            FilesystemPermission(
                operations=["write"],
                paths=["/workspace/**"],
                mode="deny",
            ),
        ],
    )
except NotImplementedError:
    pass

# Also raises: /** covers both routes and the default
try:
    create_deep_agent(
        model=model,
        backend=composite,
        permissions=[
            FilesystemPermission(
                operations=["read"],
                paths=["/**"],
                mode="deny",
            ),
        ],
    )
except NotImplementedError:
    pass
```
