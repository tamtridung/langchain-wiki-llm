Tools

Connect Deep Agents to custom functions, APIs, databases, and any MCP server

Copy page

Deep Agents can call any tool you define, any [LangChain tool](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools/), and tools from any [MCP server](#mcp-tools).
Pass them to `create_deep_agent` via the `tools=` parameter alongside the [built-in harness tools](/oss/python/deepagents/overview#execution-environment) for planning, file management, and subagent spawning.

```
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
    tools=[search, fetch_url, run_query],
)
```

[​](#custom-tools) Custom tools
-------------------------------

Pass any callable — plain functions, LangChain `@tool`-decorated functions, or tool dicts — directly to `tools=`.
Deep Agents infers the tool schema from the function signature and docstring, so you don’t need to define a separate schema in most cases.

    topic: Literal["general", "news", "finance"] = "general",
    include_raw_content: bool = False,

    """Run a web search"""
    return tavily_client.search(
        query,
        max_results=max_results,
        include_raw_content=include_raw_content,
        topic=topic,
    )


agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="google_genai:gemini-3.5-flash",
    tools=[internet_search],
)
```

For full details on defining and using LangChain tools (tool dicts, `StructuredTool`, return types, error handling, and more), see [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools).

[​](#mcp-tools) MCP tools
-------------------------

Deep Agents fully support [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/oss/python/langchain/mcp) — the open standard for connecting agents to external services. Load tools from any MCP server and pass them directly to `create_deep_agent`.

MCP is an open protocol that lets agents connect to a growing ecosystem of servers — databases, APIs, file systems, browsers, and more — through a standard interface. Instead of writing custom integration code for each service, you point Deep Agents at an MCP server and it gets all the tools that server exposes.
Install `langchain-mcp-adapters` to connect to MCP servers:

```
pip install langchain-mcp-adapters
```

```
import asyncio
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

async def main():
    async with MultiServerMCPClient(
        {
            "my_server": {
                "transport": "http",
                "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
            }
        }
    ) as client:
        tools = await client.get_tools()

        agent = create_deep_agent(
            model="openai:gpt-5.5",
            tools=tools,
        )

        result = await agent.ainvoke(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Use the MCP server to help me."}]},
            config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}},
        )

asyncio.run(main())
```

For detailed configuration options — including stdio servers, OAuth authentication, tool filtering, and stateful sessions — see the full [MCP guide](/oss/python/langchain/mcp).

[​](#built-in-harness-tools) Built-in harness tools
---------------------------------------------------

In addition to the tools you provide, every Deep Agent comes with a built-in set of tools from the harness:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ls` | List files in a directory |
| `read_file` | Read file contents (with pagination and multimodal support) |
| `write_file` | Create new files |
| `edit_file` | Perform exact string replacements in files |
| `glob` | Find files matching a glob pattern |
| `grep` | Search file contents |
| `execute` | Run shell commands (sandbox backends only) |
| `task` | Spawn a subagent to handle a delegated task |
| `write_todos` | Manage a structured todo list |

For a full breakdown of what each built-in tool does, see [Harness overview](/oss/python/deepagents/overview#execution-environment).

[​](#multimodal-tool-outputs) Multimodal tool outputs
-----------------------------------------------------

Custom tools can return plain text or [standard content blocks](/oss/python/langchain/messages#standard-content-blocks) (text, images, audio, video, and files) when the selected model supports multimodal tool results. The built-in `read_file` tool also returns multimodal blocks for supported non-text file types.
Return a string for text-only results, or an ordered list of content blocks for text plus media or interleaved multimodal output. See [Multimodal](/oss/python/deepagents/multimodal) and [Tool return values](/oss/python/langchain/tools#return-multimodal-content) for examples and context-compression considerations.
