# Protocol v2 Event Stream (SSE)

> Open a connection-scoped SSE event stream for a thread. The request body is a `ProtocolEventStreamRequest` carrying channel and namespace filters; the server replies with `Content-Type: text/event-stream` and pushes matching `ProtocolEvent` frames for the lifetime of the connection. Closing the connection unsubscribes — no state is persisted server-side.

Reconnect: clients pass the last `seq` they received as `since` in the body. Buffered events with `seq > since` are replayed before the stream goes live. The endpoint is POST-only, so browser-native `EventSource` auto-resume (`Last-Event-ID`) does not apply — clients drive resume explicitly via the body.
