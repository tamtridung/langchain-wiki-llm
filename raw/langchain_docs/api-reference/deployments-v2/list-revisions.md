  title: LangSmith Deployment Control Plane API
  description: >
    The LangSmith Deployment Control Plane API is used to programmatically
    create and manage

    Agent Server deployments. For example, the APIs can be orchestrated to

    create custom CI/CD workflows.


    ## Host

    https://api.host.langchain.com


    ## Authentication

    To authenticate with the LangSmith Deployment Control Plane API, set the
    `X-Api-Key` header

    to a valid [LangSmith API
    key](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/create-account-api-key#create-an-api-key).


    ## Versioning

    Each endpoint path is prefixed with a version (e.g. `v1`, `v2`).


    ## Quick Start

    1. Call `POST /v2/deployments` to create a new Deployment. The response body
    contains the Deployment ID (`id`) and the ID of the latest (and first)
    revision (`latest_revision_id`).

    1. Call `GET /v2/deployments/{deployment_id}` to retrieve the Deployment.
    Set `deployment_id` in the URL to the value of Deployment ID (`id`).

    1. Poll for revision `status` until `status` is `DEPLOYED` by calling `GET
    /v2/deployments/{deployment_id}/revisions/{latest_revision_id}`.

    1. Call `PATCH /v2/deployments/{deployment_id}` to update the deployment.
